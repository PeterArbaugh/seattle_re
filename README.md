# Asking Price and Final Price in Seattle & Tacoma

A dashboard built in Streamlit to answer the question "How much over asking should I expect to pay for real estate in Seattle and Tacoma?"

I built this at the tail end of the pandemic real estate boom to try to parse the state of the market. I only collected data on listings less than $1 million USD.
