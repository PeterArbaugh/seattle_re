# Asking Price and Final Price in Seattle & Tacoma

A dashboard built in Streamlit to answer the question "How much over asking should I expect to pay for real estate in Seattle and Tacoma?"

I built this at the tail end of the pandemic real estate boom to try to parse the state of the market. I only collected data on listings less than $1 million USD.

Notes:
- Due to a bug, sale data wasn't imported for much of December 2022. I manually pulled data to fill some of the gap, but there may be discrepancies. The manual data pull is saved as
    - for_sale/2022-12-22_for_sale.csv
